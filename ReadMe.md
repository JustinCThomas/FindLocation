This program was adapted from FreeCodeCamp's "Get Geolocation Data" exercise.

It asks the browser for the user's current geographic coordinates and if the 
user gives permission, displays the the coordinates.

The program also generates a Google Maps link using those coordinates to 
estimate where the user currently is.
